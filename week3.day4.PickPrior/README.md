# week3.day4.pickPrior

## Instructions
1. Looking through the projects you’ve worked on in Week1 (p5.js), Week2 (Intro to Web Dev), and Week3 (this week!), are there any you REALLY want to spend more time on? Given what you know now, are there any projects you wish you could go back to and enhance? This is that opportunity!
2. Pick a prior project from the last 3 weeks to work on today
   - You are welcome to work individually or in a group (even if the project you’re picking was originally a group project)
3. Requirements:
   - Your project should include multiple web pages (at least 2)
   - The user should be able to navigate between these pages (links, navigation bar, etc.)
   - All web pages should be responsive and work properly on a mobile device:
     - The target device is iPhone5 (320x568)
   - At least one web page should include 2 or more event handlers
   - At least one web page should utilize 1 or more JS objects (storing data, consolidating method responsibility, etc.)
   - The website must be properly hosted on GitHub
4. There are 2 approval steps before you should begin working!
5. First, present your idea to your instructors, making sure to outline:
   - Which project you’re picking
   - What you propose to do in order to enhance the prior project
     - You have ~3 hours to work, so be realistic!
   - Who’s in your group
     - If you’re in a group, you must mention what each person is doing
   - If it is not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again
6. Once approved, make your wireframes:
   - Remember, each web page should have a desktop and a mobile wireframe
   - Also, since the web pages are connected, it’s important to show how users will traverse/travel through your website.
7. Once done, present your wireframes to your instructional team
If your wireframes are not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again.
8. Once approved, you may begin working. Enjoy!
   - For our records, at the top of your “index.html” file, mention that this is the project you’ve picked for the “Pick a Prior Project” assignment. Also, mention the group members and their responsibilities.
